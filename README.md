This repository contains example content for the Baibulo.NET implementation

To test it checkout https://github.com/padcom/baibulo-net to one folder and this repository on the same level under the name "content". This will effectively give you 2 folders:

    baibulo-net
    content

Once you start the Baibulo project it will serve content from the "content" folder. There is no default file so you need to specify the actual file name!
